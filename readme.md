# ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome!

I'm Natallia Zylevich â€” a passionate QA Engineer with a unique background in sports psychology. I bring a fresh, people-focused approach to software testing and team collaboration. Since 2021, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into software QA, starting with hands-on training and continuing through real-world projects for web and mobile applications.

ðŸ’¼ I specialize in manual testing, exploratory testing, and API validation, but Iâ€™m also expanding into automation and backend testing. I love finding bugs before users do â€” and making products better every step of the way.
