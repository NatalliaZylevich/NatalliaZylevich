# Software Quality Engineer | Manual & Automation | People-Focused Testing

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Natallia Zylevich ðŸ‘‹ â€” a Software Quality Engineer passionate about delivering smooth, reliable, and bug-free experiences.  

I have around **3 years of QA experience** across web and mobile applications. I have hands-on experience in **manual, exploratory, regression, API, and SQL database testing**. Right now, Iâ€™m also learning automation and applying it in projects to expand my skills.  

What makes me unique is my background in **sports psychology**. It helps me better understand people â€” from end-users to teammates â€” and bring a people-focused approach to testing, communication, and collaboration.  

I'm exploring **automation and AI-assisted tools**, which help me work faster, improve test coverage, and better understand complex systems. I see them as a way to support both manual and automation testing, making the QA process more efficient and effective.  

ðŸ’¼ **What I Bring:**  
- Manual, exploratory & regression testing  
- API testing (Postman, Swagger)  
- SQL database validation (MySQL, PostgreSQL)  
- Learning automation with Playwright & JavaScript  
- Strong teamwork, communication & problem-solving  

I take pride in catching critical issues early and helping teams release products with confidence ðŸš€
